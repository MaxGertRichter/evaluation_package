A Python package for evaluating quantum sensing experiments. At the moment it includes evaluation code for analyzing ESR (Electron Spin Resonance) and Rabi measurements.

## Features

- Load and process experiment data from YAML and NumPy files
- Calculate ESR spectra and analyze peaks
- Process Rabi oscillation measurements
- Calculate light levels and contrast
- Cross-platform support (Windows and macOS)

## Installation

TODO:

```bash
